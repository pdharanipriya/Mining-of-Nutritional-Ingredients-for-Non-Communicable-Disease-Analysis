Hyperkalemia is a condition where potassium levels in the blood become dangerously high, which can disrupt normal muscle and nerve function, particularly in the heart. Potassium is essential for maintaining fluid balance, nerve signaling, and muscle contractions, but excessive levels can cause serious health complications. Hyperkalemia is usually caused by kidney disease (since the kidneys regulate potassium levels), excessive potassium intake, certain medications (like ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics), dehydration, and adrenal gland disorders.

Symptoms of hyperkalemia vary depending on severity. Mild cases may have no noticeable symptoms, while moderate to severe cases can lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, numbness, nausea, irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), and even cardiac arrest in extreme situations. Since high potassium levels can be life-threatening, immediate medical attention is necessary if symptoms appear.

Preventing and managing hyperkalemia requires controlling potassium intake and addressing underlying health conditions. People with kidney disease or at risk of high potassium levels should regularly monitor their blood potassium levels and adjust their diet accordingly.

A low-potassium diet for hyperkalemia management includes:

Low-potassium vegetables (cabbage, cauliflower, green beans) instead of high-potassium options like potatoes or tomatoes
Apples, berries, and grapes instead of high-potassium fruits like bananas and oranges
Rice, white bread, and refined grains in place of whole grains (since they have higher potassium content)
Lean meats, poultry, and egg whites instead of potassium-rich plant-based proteins like beans and lentils
To further reduce potassium levels, individuals can leach vegetables (boiling them in water and draining before eating), stay hydrated, and avoid potassium-based salt substitutes. In severe cases, medications like potassium binders or dialysis may be needed to lower potassium levels quickly.
