Liver damage occurs when the liver's ability to function is impaired due to inflammation, fat accumulation, or scarring (fibrosis). One of the most common liver conditions is Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), which develops due to excess fat buildup in the liver, often linked to obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, and an unhealthy diet. Over time, NAFLD can progress to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, or liver failure if left untreated.

Liver damage is often silent in its early stages, but as it progresses, symptoms may include:

Fatigue and weakness
Abdominal pain or discomfort (especially in the upper right side)
Unexplained weight loss
Swelling in the legs and abdomen (fluid retention)
Yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)
Dark urine and pale-colored stools
Prevention and Lifestyle Changes
Preventing and managing liver damage involves maintaining a healthy weight, reducing sugar and fat intake, staying physically active, and avoiding alcohol and unnecessary medications that stress the liver. Managing diabetes, cholesterol, and high blood pressure is also essential for liver health.

Liver-Friendly Diet
Increase intake of:

Leafy greens (spinach, kale) to reduce fat accumulation in the liver
High-fiber foods (whole grains, fruits, vegetables) to aid digestion and reduce fat buildup
Lean proteins (fish, chicken, legumes) for muscle maintenance
Nuts and seeds (walnuts, flaxseeds) for healthy fats and antioxidants
Limit intake of:

Processed foods, fried foods, and refined carbohydrates (white bread, pastries)
Sugary drinks (soda, artificial juices) to reduce fat deposits in the liver
Red meat and full-fat dairy, which can contribute to fatty liver disease
Drink plenty of water to help detoxify the liver and improve overall function. Green tea and coffee (in moderation) have also been shown to support liver health.

If NAFLD progresses, medical interventions such as medications or liver transplantation may be required in severe cases.
