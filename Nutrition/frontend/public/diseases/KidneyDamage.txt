Kidney damage, also known as chronic kidney disease (CKD), occurs when the kidneys lose their ability to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. This can lead to serious complications such as fluid buildup, high blood pressure, anemia, weak bones, nerve damage, and, in severe cases, kidney failure. CKD is often caused by diabetes, hypertension, frequent use of certain medications (like painkillers), kidney infections, or genetic disorders.

In the early stages, CKD may not cause noticeable symptoms. However, as the disease progresses, symptoms can include:

Swelling in the legs, ankles, or face (due to fluid retention)
Fatigue and weakness
Nausea and vomiting
Changes in urination (frequent or reduced urine output)
Muscle cramps and itching
Shortness of breath (due to fluid buildup in the lungs)
Preventing kidney damage involves managing underlying conditions like diabetes and hypertension, staying hydrated, and avoiding excessive use of painkillers and high-sodium foods. Regular kidney function tests can help detect issues early.

A kidney-friendly diet focuses on reducing strain on the kidneys and includes:

Low sodium intake: Avoid processed and packaged foods to prevent fluid retention and high blood pressure.
Controlled protein intake: Moderate amounts of lean protein (chicken, fish, eggs) to reduce kidney workload.
Balanced potassium and phosphorus levels:
Low-potassium foods: Apples, berries, cabbage, and rice (helpful in later CKD stages).
Limit high-potassium foods: Bananas, oranges, potatoes, and spinach.
Adequate fluid intake: Staying hydrated but avoiding excessive water in advanced kidney disease.
For individuals with advanced CKD or kidney failure, dialysis or kidney transplantation may be necessary.
