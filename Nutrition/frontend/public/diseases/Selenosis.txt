Selenosis is a rare but serious condition caused by excessive selenium intake, leading to toxic effects in the body. Selenium is an essential trace mineral that supports thyroid function, antioxidant activity, and immune health, but consuming too much can be harmful. Selenosis typically occurs due to overuse of selenium supplements, consuming selenium-rich foods in excessive amounts, or exposure to high-selenium environments. Long-term toxicity can result in neurological issues, organ damage, and metabolic disturbances.

Symptoms of selenosis include hair loss, brittle nails, skin rashes, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, a metallic taste in the mouth, and a garlic-like breath odor. In severe cases, excessive selenium can lead to nerve damage, difficulty breathing, kidney and liver problems, and even fatal complications.

Preventing selenosis involves monitoring selenium intake and avoiding unnecessary supplementation unless prescribed by a healthcare provider. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for selenium is 55 micrograms per day for adults, with a tolerable upper limit of 400 micrograms per day. People at risk of excessive selenium intake should limit high-selenium foods such as Brazil nuts (which contain extremely high levels of selenium), organ meats, seafood, and selenium-fortified products.

A balanced diet should focus on moderate selenium consumption through natural sources like lean meats, eggs, dairy, whole grains, and nuts (in limited amounts).
