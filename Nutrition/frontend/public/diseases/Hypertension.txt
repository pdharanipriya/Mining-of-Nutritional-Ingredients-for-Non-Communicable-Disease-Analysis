Hypertension, or high blood pressure, occurs when the force of blood against artery walls is consistently high, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage. It often develops due to factors such as genetics, obesity, excessive salt intake, a sedentary lifestyle, chronic stress, smoking, alcohol consumption, and underlying conditions like diabetes or kidney disease. Long-term uncontrolled hypertension can weaken blood vessels, leading to severe complications like heart attacks, vision problems, and aneurysms.

Hypertension is often called a “silent killer” because it may not cause noticeable symptoms. However, in severe cases, individuals may experience headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, vision disturbances, or nosebleeds. Since symptoms are not always present, regular blood pressure monitoring is essential for early detection.

Preventing and managing hypertension requires lifestyle modifications. Reducing salt intake, engaging in regular exercise like brisk walking or yoga, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, and avoiding alcohol and smoking are key steps. Relaxation techniques like meditation, deep breathing, and adequate sleep can also help regulate blood pressure naturally.

A heart-healthy diet is crucial in managing blood pressure. The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is highly recommended, which includes:

High intake of: Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins (fish, chicken, tofu), nuts, seeds, and low-fat dairy
Limited intake of: Processed foods, high-sodium meals, sugary drinks, and saturated fats
Beneficial nutrients: Potassium-rich foods like bananas, sweet potatoes, spinach, and avocados help counteract sodium’s effects, while magnesium and fiber-rich foods like oats, beans, and lentils support healthy blood pressure.
For individuals diagnosed with hypertension, medications such as diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors may be prescribed, alongside lifestyle changes. Managing hypertension effectively lowers the risk of serious cardiovascular complications, improving overall health and well-being.
